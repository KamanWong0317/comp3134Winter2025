1) Ben
- No data can be found. This is because Ben's active value in the table is 0, so no user matches
- This is expected behavior.

2) Ben'-- 
- Find out the user whose first name is Ben. A single quote and two dashes cause `AND active = 1` to be annotated, and the filtering condition is bypassed.
- Unqualified user information should not be successfully queried and displayed.

3) Ben' or 1=1
- The server returns 500 Internal Server Error, indicating that a syntax error occurred while running the PHP script.
- Instead of returning a result, it causes a query failure and a system error.
